Distributed Parallel Algorithms
</H3>

<P>
Gurobi Compute Server supports distributed parallel parameter tuning
and distributed concurrent MIP solving.  These features allow you to
distribute the associated computation among multiple machines.  The
optimization model of interest is copied to the available machines,
and the machines each use different parameter settings to solve the
model.  In the case of distributed tuning, one machine doles out
parameter sets among machines, collects the results, compares runtimes
to those of the best parameter sets found so far, and chooses new
parameter settings to test.  In the case of distributed concurrent
MIP, one machine doles our different parameter sets to the available
machines, starts a single MIP solve on each machine, and then keeps
track of the best available lower and upper bounds for the model.
When one machine finds a proven optimal solution, the computation is
interrupted on other machines and the optimal solution is reported.
Both of these distributed parallel algorithms are designed to be
almost entirely transparent to the user.  The user simply modifies a
few parameters, and the work of distributing the computation to
multiple machines is handled behind the scenes by the Gurobi library.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Specifying the Compute Server Pool</SPAN>

<P>
The first step when doing distributed tuning or distributed concurrent
MIP is to provide a list of one or more Compute Servers that are
running and available.  You should following the instructions for
<A HREF="setting_up_and_administeri.html#sec:CSAdmin">setting up and administering a Gurobi Compute
  Server</A> to set these up.

<P>
Distributed tuning actually only requires a single licensed Compute
Server, even if you want to use multiple machines for tuning.  We
allow you to start as many free <EM>restricted</EM> Compute Servers as
you want.  A restricted Compute Server is a machine that runs Gurobi
Compute Server, but will only accept jobs that are associated with
distributed parallel tuning.  By contrast, distributed concurrent MIP
will only distribute work among fully licensed Compute Servers.
Again, please refer to the instructions for <A HREF="setting_up_and_administeri.html#sec:CSAdmin">setting up an
  administering a Gurobi Compute Server</A> for details
on setting up a restricted or standard Compute Server.

<P>
Once you've set up a set of one or more Compute Servers, you should
list their names in the
<A HREF="serverpool.html#parameter:ServerPool">ServerPool</A> parameter.  You
can provide either machine names or IP addresses, and they should
be comma-separated.  For example, you might use the following in
your <code>gurobi_cl</code> command line:
<PRE>
gurobi_cl ServerPool=server1,server2,server3 ...
</PRE>
You can provide the Compute Server access password through the
<A HREF="serverpassword.html#parameter:ServerPassword">ServerPassword</A> parameter.
All servers in the server pool must have the same access password.

<P>
We should reiterate that distributed tuning only requires one of the
machines in the server pool to be a licensed Compute Server.  The rest
can be restricted Compute Servers.  For distributed concurrent MIP,
all servers in the list must be licensed Compute Servers.

<P>
Note that providing a list of available servers is strictly a
configuration step. It doesn't actually modify any algorithm behavior.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Requesting Distributed Algorithms</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've set up the server pool through the appropriate parameters,
your next step is to set the
<A HREF="tunejobs.html#parameter:TuneJobs">TuneJobs</A> or
<A HREF="concurrentmipjobs.html#parameter:ConcurrentMIPJobs">ConcurrentMIPJobs</A>
parameter.  These parameters indicate how many distinct
tuning or concurrent MIP jobs should be started on the available
Compute Servers.  For example, if you set <code>TuneJobs</code> to 2
in <code>grbtune</code>...
<PRE>
&gt; grbtune ServerPool=server1,server2 TuneJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log:
<PRE>
Server capacity available on server1 - running now
Server capacity available on server2 - running now

Distributed tuning: launched 2 server jobs
</PRE>
This output indicates that two jobs have been launched, one on machine
<code>server1</code> and the other on machine <code>server2</code>.  These two
jobs will continue to run on these servers until your tuning run
completes.

<P>
Similarly, if you launch distributed concurrent MIP...
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl ServerPool=server1,server2 ConcurrentMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log:
<PRE>
Server capacity available on server1 - running now
Server capacity available on server2 - running now

Distributed concurrent MIP optimizer: launched 2 concurrent instances
</PRE>

<P>
If some of the servers in your server pool are running at capacity
when you launch a distributed algorithm, the algorithm won't queue
jobs.  Instead, it will launch as many jobs as it can (up to the
requested value), and it will run with these jobs.

<P>
While it may be tempting to equate jobs with machines, note that there
are situations where you may want to run multiple jobs on the same
server.  For example, if you have an 8-core server and a 4-core
server, you may wish to limit the thread count on each job to 4 and
allow two jobs to run on the 8-core server.  You would achieve this
by using the <A HREF="threads.html#parameter:Threads">Threads</A> parameter to limit
the thread count per job, and the <code>JOBLIMIT</code> server
configuration option to limit the number of jobs per Compute Server
(refer to the section on <A HREF="server_configuration.html#sec:CSConfig">Compute Server configuration</A> for details).  If you set
the job limit to 2 on the 8-core machine (call it <code>server1</code>) and
to 1 on the 4-core machine (call it <code>server2</code>), you might see
output that looks like the following when you run distributed tuning:
<PRE>
Server capacity available on server1 - running now
Server capacity available on server2 - running now
Server capacity available on server1 - running now
</PRE>
Since Gurobi Compute Server assigns a new job to the machine with the
most available capacity, then assuming that the two servers are
otherwise idle, the first job would be assigned to <code>server1</code>, the
second to <code>server2</code>, and the third to <code>server1</code>.

<P>
As for the actual behavior of the distributed tuning and concurrent
MIP algorithms, they are designed to be nearly indistinguishable from
the single machine versions.  In particular, distributed tuning
respects all of the usual tuning parameters, including
<A HREF="tunetimelimit.html#parameter:TuneTimeLimit">TuneTimeLimit</A>,
<A HREF="tunetrials.html#parameter:TuneTrials">TuneTrials</A>, and
<A HREF="tuneoutput.html#parameter:TuneOutput">TuneOutput</A>.  Similarly,
concurrent MIP respects all of the usual MIP parameters.  Like the
version that runs on a single machine, distributed concurrent MIP can
be controlled using <A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:ConcurrentControl">concurrent
  environments</A>.  The only major
difference you should notice between the distributed and
single-machines versions is in the aggregate performance.

<P>
One important thing we should note is that distributed algorithms can
be affected by differences in machine speed.  Consider tuning, for
example.  If one machine in your server pool is much slower than the
others, any parameter sets that are run on the slower machine will
appear to be less effective than if they were run on a faster machine.
For this reason, we recommend that you use machines with similar
performance when running distributed parallel algorithms.  Similarly,
if your machines have different core counts, we suggest that you use
the <A HREF="threads.html#parameter:Threads">Threads</A> parameter to make sure
that all tests use the same number of cores (since, by default, Gurobi
will use all cores in the machine).
